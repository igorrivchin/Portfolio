# Personal Portfolio Flutter App

This is a mobile version of my portfolio - built with Flutter. My web and mobile portfolios are very different layouts, but contain all the same information. View web version here: https://ryanlertoladev.herokuapp.com/.

FYI - Most of my Javascript projects are not optimized for mobile, so viewing the live demos from the app isn't great. I mainly just wanted to build a Flutter app. I will be adding more mobile projects as I go.
